<h1>Python Keylogger</h1>

<h2>Description:</h2>

This project consists of creating a keylogger program using the Python coding language. Keyloggers record keystrokes on the system where it's being run. Keyloggers can be used to record login information by threat actors to gain access to systems. I will be testing this on the [Login page using PHP and MySQL](https://github.com/ntieu4328/Login-and-Signup-page-with-PHP-and-MySQL) project that I made.

<b>IMPORTANT:</b> This project was only made for educational purposes to see how a keylogger works.

<h2>Environments Used:</h2>

  - Python
  
  - XAMPP
    
  - phpMyAdmin

<h2>Walk-through:</h2>

1. Download or import the KeyLogger.py code into an IDE.

2. Run the program.

3. Log into an account. I premade a user on my Login page that I made with the following credentials:

Username: nathan

Password: qwer1122!!@@

Login information in Database:

4. Stop program.
  
5. If you look in the folder where the KeyLogger.py is, there should be a new keyfile.txt that was made by the program.

6. If you look at the contents you can see all of the information that I typed while the KeyLogger.py was being run:

7. If you look at the contents of the keyfile.txt you can see that the login information is present along with other things I typed.

<b>Project is done!!!</b>
